## [Archived old instructions]()


## Experimental scripts

the experimental scripts located in the scripts folder in this repo ask you if you want to install each app, if yes they install it. they will stay experimental untill they can also fix stuff (like the choppy audio problem). I plan on adding a GUI in the future.<br>
<b>To run:</b><br>
open terminal and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/Ubuntu-on-rpi-fixes.git; cd Ubuntu-on-rpi-fixes; sudo chmod +x main.sh; ./main.sh
```
